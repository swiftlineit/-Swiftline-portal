/**
 * Surcharges, insurance and discount configured for one shipping route.
 *
 * A "route" is a destination country plus a service (Courier or Cargo) — the same
 * key the weight slabs in `countryRateCard.model.ts` are grouped by. The slabs are
 * stored one document per weight band, so these values deliberately live in their
 * own single document per route: an admin sets the fuel percentage once instead of
 * repeating it on every slab, and two slabs can never disagree about it.
 *
 * Amounts are plain rupees, matching `chargesPerKg` on the rate card and the
 * arithmetic in `shipmentPricing.service.ts`. Conversion to minor units happens
 * once, at the invoicing and credit boundaries.
 *
 * A route with no document prices exactly as it did before this config existed:
 * every surcharge reads zero. That is what keeps historical shipments and
 * unconfigured routes unchanged, so no migration is required.
