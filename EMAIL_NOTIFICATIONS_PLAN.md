# AWS SES Email Notifications- Feature Plan

Date: 2026-07-27
Status: Planning (no implementation yet)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Swiftline Portal already has a **working in-app notification system** (`portalNotification.service.ts`, 18 event types, idempotency-keyed, audience fan-out helpers) and a **minimal email service** (`mail.service.ts`, nodemailer + SMTP, exactly 2 emails: client invitation and password reset).

The right move is **not** to build a second, parallel email system. It is to make **email a delivery channel on the notification event that already exists**, then extend the event catalogue to cover the ~60 lifecycle moments that currently notify nobody.

Three decisions drive this plan:

1. **Email rides the existing notification fan-out.** One domain event → one audience resolution → N recipients → per-recipient channel dispatch (in-app + email). We do not sprinkle `sendMail()` calls across 30 services.
2. **Transactional outbox, not inline sends.** The existing notify helpers accept a Mongoose `session` and are called *inside* transactions (`creditPayment.service.ts`, `creditBillingCycle.service.ts`). An email cannot be un-sent when a transaction rolls back. Emails must be enqueued in the same transaction and dispatched after commit.
3. **SES replaces SMTP as a transport, not as an API.** Keep nodemailer as the MIME builder (we need PDF attachments for invoices and statements) and swap the transport to SESv2. Dev keeps SMTP/Mailhog; prod uses SES.

## 2. What Already Exists

### 2.1 Email (thin)
| Item | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sendClientInvitationEmail` | [mail.service.ts:122](portal/backend/src/services/mail.service.ts#L122) | Called from [businessAccountAccess.controller.ts:121](portal/backend/src/controllers/businessAccountAccess.controller.ts#L121) |
| `sendPasswordResetEmail` | [mail.service.ts:153](portal/backend/src/services/mail.service.ts#L153) | Called from [auth.controller.ts:249](portal/backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts#L249) |
| SMTP env vars | [config/env.ts:31-36](portal/backend/src/config/env.ts#L31-L36) | `SMTP_HOST/PORT/SECURE/USER/PASSWORD`, `MAIL_FROM`- all optional |

**Gaps:** no queue, no retry, no send log, no bounce handling, no templating layer (HTML is hand-built per function), no unsubscribe, no attachments, no per-user preferences. Sends are inline and awaited on the request path.

### 2.2 In-app notifications (solid foundation)
- [portalNotification.model.ts](portal/backend/src/models/portalNotification.model.ts)- 18 types, unique `idempotencyKey`, `metadata`, `href`, `readAt`.
- [portalNotification.service.ts](portal/backend/src/services/portalNotification.service.ts)- audience helpers, all session-aware:
  - `notifyActiveAdmins` → `User{role:"admin", userStatus:"active"}`
  - `notifyBusinessFinancialMembers` → members `account_owner|account_admin|finance`
  - `notifyBusinessQuoteMembers` → members `account_owner|account_admin|operations|finance`
  - `notifyPortalUsers` → explicit user id list
- Idempotency is per-recipient (`${key}:${userId}`) via upsert- **this same discipline is what makes email-dedupe safe.**

**Only 11 call sites exist today:** credit billing/account/payment, shipment cancellation, shipment quote, support ticket. Everything else in the portal is silent.

### 2.3 Roles
- **Staff** (`user.model.ts`): `admin`, `operations`, `accounts`, `delivery`, `hr`, `client` (+legacy `staff`)
- **Business members** (`businessAccountMember.model.ts`): `account_owner`, `account_admin`, `operations`, `finance`, `tracking_only`; plus `creditPermissions[]`

### 2.4 Scheduled jobs
No in-process cron. Existing pattern is **standalone scripts invoked externally**: `job:credit:close-billing`, `job:credit:expire-reservations`, `job:credit:mark-overdue`, `job:credit:reconcile`. Due-date reminder emails should follow this exact pattern, not introduce `node-cron`.

## 3. Target Architecture

```
Domain service (in txn)
   └─ emitNotification(event)                    ← single entry point
        ├─ resolveAudience(event)                ← role/permission → user[]
        ├─ PortalNotification.bulkWrite(session)  ← in-app (existing)
        └─ EmailOutbox.insertMany(session)        ← NEW: queued, not sent
                    │
              [txn commits]
                    │
        ┌───────────┴────────────┐
   post-commit drain        job:email:drain (safety net, catches
   (best-effort, fast)       crashed/failed/retryable rows)
                    │
             emailDispatcher
                ├─ preference + suppression check
                ├─ render template (MJML/JSX → HTML + text)
                ├─ nodemailer buildMessage → raw MIME
                └─ SESv2 SendEmailCommand
                            │
                     SES Configuration Set
                            │
                        SNS topic
                            │
                  POST /api/v1/webhooks/ses  → EmailSuppression + EmailLog status
```

### 3.1 New models

**`emailOutbox.model.ts`**- the queue and the audit log in one.
| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `idempotencyKey` (unique) | `${notificationKey}:${userId}:email`- hard guarantee against double-send on job reruns |
| `recipientUserId`, `toEmail` | resolved at enqueue time (email may change later; we send to what we resolved) |
| `businessAccountId` | scoping / admin filtering |
| `templateKey` | e.g. `SHIPMENT_BOOKED` |
| `payload` | template variables (denormalized- template must render without re-querying) |
| `status` | `PENDING → SENDING → SENT → DELIVERED` / `FAILED` / `BOUNCED` / `COMPLAINED` / `SUPPRESSED` / `CANCELLED` |
| `attempts`, `nextAttemptAt`, `lastError` | exponential backoff |
| `sesMessageId` | correlates SNS events back to the row |
| `category` | `TRANSACTIONAL` \| `OPERATIONAL` \| `MARKETING`- drives preference enforcement |
| `priority` | lets invoices/security jump ahead of digests |

**`emailPreference.model.ts`**- per user, per category/type opt-out. Transactional cannot be disabled.

**`emailSuppression.model.ts`**- hard bounces + complaints, keyed by email. Checked before every send. Account-level protection: SES suspends sending above 5% bounce / 0.1% complaint.

### 3.2 Transport layer
`services/email/` (new folder):
- `sesClient.ts`- `@aws-sdk/client-sesv2`, IAM role in prod, keys in dev
- `transport.ts`- driver interface; `SesTransport` + `SmtpTransport` + `NoopTransport` (tests/local)
- `renderer.ts`- template registry, layout wrapper, HTML + plaintext
- `dispatcher.ts`- preference/suppression checks, retry, SES call
- `templates/`- one module per `templateKey`

**Why nodemailer stays:** SESv2 `SendEmail` with `Content.Simple` cannot do attachments. Invoice/statement PDFs require `Content.Raw` with a full MIME blob- nodemailer's `MailComposer` builds that correctly (encoding, multipart boundaries, headers). Rewriting MIME by hand is a bug farm.

### 3.3 AWS setup (prerequisite, ~2-3 days of DNS + approval latency)
1. Verify sending **domain** (not just an address) in SES, region `ap-south-1` (matches India-centric portal; confirm against existing infra).
2. Enable **Easy DKIM** (3 CNAMEs), add **SPF** TXT (`include:amazonses.com`), add **DMARC** (`p=none` → tighten to `quarantine` after 2 weeks of clean reports).
3. Create a **Configuration Set** with event destination → SNS topic → HTTPS subscription to our webhook. Subscribe to: `Bounce`, `Complaint`, `Delivery`, `Reject`, `RenderingFailure`.
4. **Request production access** (exits the 200/day, verified-recipients-only sandbox). Requires describing bounce/complaint handling- have the suppression model ready before applying.
5. Separate identities/config sets per environment; staging must never send to real client addresses (see §7).

### 3.4 New env vars
`AWS_REGION`, `SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`, `SES_FROM_ADDRESS`, `SES_REPLY_TO`, `MAIL_DRIVER` (`ses|smtp|noop`), `MAIL_SAFELIST` (staging guard), `APP_PUBLIC_URL` (for deep links), `SES_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## 4. The Email Catalogue

**Audience legend- client side:** `OWN` account_owner · `ADM` account_admin · `FIN` finance · `BOPS` business operations · `TRK` tracking_only · `ACTOR` the user who performed the action
**Audience legend- staff side:** `ADMIN` role:admin · `OPS` role:operations · `ACCT` role:accounts · `DELIV` role:delivery

`★` = in-app notification type already exists, email is a pure add-on (cheapest wins)
`▲` = no notification exists today; new event needed

## 5. Preferences & Volume Control

Volume is the main product risk. A client booking 200 shipments/day would receive thousands of emails under a naive design.

**Rules:**
1. **Transactional (`TXN`) cannot be unsubscribed**- invoices, payments, security, legal agreements, account status. Regulatory and contractual necessity.
2. **Operational (`OPS`) is preference-controlled**- tracking milestones, reminders, digests. Per-user, per-type toggles in portal settings.
3. **Tracking milestones default to OFF for per-event email, ON for daily digest.** Explicit opt-in for real-time.
4. **Digest rollup** for high-volume types: batch by business account, one email per window.
5. **Throttle/coalesce**: if >N emails of one type queue for one recipient within a window, collapse into a summary. `EmailOutbox` supports this via a `coalesceKey`.
6. **Quiet hours** (IST) for non-urgent OPS mail; urgent TXN always sends immediately.
7. **`List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers** on all OPS mail (Gmail/Yahoo bulk-sender requirement) with a signed, no-login-required token URL.

---

## 6. Delivery, Reliability & Compliance

- **Retry**: exponential backoff (1m, 5m, 30m, 2h, 12h), max 5 attempts. Distinguish retryable (throttling, 5xx, network) from terminal (invalid address, suppressed)- never retry terminal.
- **Suppression enforcement**: check `EmailSuppression` before send; hard bounce → permanent suppress; complaint → permanent suppress + flag account for review; soft bounce → retry then suppress after 3.
- **Rate limiting**: respect the SES account send rate; token-bucket in the dispatcher. Concurrency cap on the drain worker.
- **Idempotency**: unique `idempotencyKey` on outbox is the single guard against duplicate sends across job reruns, retries, and concurrent workers.
- **Observability**: admin screen listing outbox rows (filter by status/type/account), per-template send/bounce/complaint rates, alert at 3% bounce / 0.08% complaint (below SES's 5%/0.1% suspension thresholds).
- **PII**: no full addresses, invoice line items, or document contents in email bodies- link into the portal instead. Attachments limited to documents the recipient is already authorized to see. Attachment cap 10 MB (SES limit); link to portal above that.
- **Data retention**: outbox `payload` purged after 90 days; status/metadata retained for audit.

---

## 7. Environment Safety

The single biggest operational hazard is **staging emailing real clients**.

- `MAIL_DRIVER=noop` in test; `smtp` (Mailhog) in local dev.
- In any non-production environment, the dispatcher **hard-filters** recipients against `MAIL_SAFELIST` and rewrites all others to a catch-all inbox. This is enforced in the dispatcher, not by configuration discipline.
- Separate SES identity + configuration set per environment so staging can never consume production reputation.
- Seed/backfill scripts must run with the outbox in `CANCELLED` mode- a backfill that enqueues 50k historical "invoice issued" emails is an unrecoverable reputation event.

---

## 8. Phased Delivery

| Phase | Scope | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **0- AWS setup** | Domain verification, DKIM/SPF/DMARC, config set, SNS topic, production access request | Can send from the domain; ~2-3 days of external latency, start immediately |
| **1- Foundation** | `EmailOutbox`/`EmailPreference`/`EmailSuppression` models, SES transport, template renderer + base layout, dispatcher with retry, `job:email:drain`, SNS webhook, env-safety guard | Infrastructure proven end-to-end with the 2 existing emails migrated off raw SMTP |
| **2- Wire existing events** | Extend `emitNotification` so all 18 current in-app types also email; ~20 templates | Immediate coverage with zero new domain logic- lowest risk, highest ratio |
| **3- P0 gaps** | Shipment booked/label/delivered/hold (§4.5, §4.6), amendments (§4.7), invoices (§4.9), payments (§4.11), onboarding (§4.2) | The events the business actually asked for |
| **4- Due dates & jobs** | `job:email:due-reminders` (T-7→T+30), digests, aging report, stuck-shipment and SLA jobs | Proactive collections; the largest single business value |
| **5- Preferences & UX** | Preference model + client/admin settings UI, unsubscribe endpoint, digest engine, quiet hours | Volume under control; unlocks tracking milestones safely |
| **6- Observability** | Admin email log screen, deliverability dashboard, bounce alerts, per-template metrics | Operable in production |

**Recommended sequencing note:** Phase 2 before Phase 3. Wiring email to the 18 existing notification types requires no new domain-event plumbing and validates the whole pipeline against real traffic before we touch 30 services.

## 9. Open Questions

1. **AWS region**- `ap-south-1` assumed for an India-centric portal. Confirm against where the app is hosted (cross-region adds latency, not correctness).
2. **Sending domain & from-address**- e.g. `no-reply@swiftline.in`; reply-to should point at support so replies become tickets. Is inbound-email-to-ticket in scope later?
3. **Existing SMTP retirement**- keep SMTP as a fallback driver, or SES-only in production?
4. **Attachment policy**- attach invoice/statement PDFs, or link-only? Attachments raise deliverability risk and size; links require login. Recommendation: attach for invoices/statements/agreements (clients expect it for accounting), link for everything else.
5. **Tracking milestone defaults**- confirm the opt-in default. This is the difference between a useful product and a spam complaint.
6. **Localization**- English-only initially? Any multi-language client base?
7. **Branding**- need the HTML email design/logo assets before Phase 1 templates.
8. **Do staff want individual emails or digests?** Recommendation: digests for volume events (new bookings, quotes), individual only for exceptions and approvals.

## 10. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Staging sends to real clients | Severe, irreversible | Dispatcher-level safelist enforcement (§7) |
| Backfill floods the outbox | SES suspension | Scripts default to `CANCELLED`; explicit flag to enable sending |
| Email sent for rolled-back transaction | Wrong data to client | Transactional outbox- enqueue in-session, send post-commit (§3) |
| Volume fatigue → complaints → SES suspension | Blocks all mail incl. password resets | Preferences, digests, coalescing (§5); alert below SES thresholds |
| Sending on the request path | Slow API, failed requests | Outbox is a write; dispatch is async |
| SES sandbox at launch | Only verified recipients receive mail | Request production access in Phase 0, not Phase 3 |
| Template drift vs. domain changes | Broken/incorrect emails | Denormalized `payload` snapshot at enqueue time; template unit tests |

## 11. Recommended Immediate Next Steps

1. Confirm the §9 open questions (region, from-address, attachment policy, tracking defaults).
2. Start **Phase 0** now- DNS propagation and SES production-access approval are external latency on the critical path.
3. Approve the Phase 1 model shapes (`EmailOutbox`, `EmailPreference`, `EmailSuppression`) before any code.
4. Confirm the P0 list in §4- 34 events is a large but achievable first release; trim if a smaller launch is preferred.
