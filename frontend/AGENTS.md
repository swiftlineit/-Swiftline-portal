# Development Approach

Before writing new code:

1. Check whether the requested feature is actually necessary.
2. Search the existing codebase for reusable components, utilities, and patterns.
3. Prefer built-in browser, framework, and standard-library features.
4. Use dependencies already installed in the project before adding new ones.
5. Avoid introducing new packages unless clearly necessary.
6. Make the smallest safe change that solves the request.
7. Do not refactor unrelated code.
8. Do not create abstractions for one-time usage.
9. Preserve existing architecture, naming conventions, and UI patterns.
10. Verify the result before considering the task complete.
