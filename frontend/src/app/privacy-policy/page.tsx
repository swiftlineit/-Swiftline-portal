                A privacy request or grievance should include the individual&rsquo;s full name, registered contact
                details, relevant account or shipment reference, a clear description of the issue and any information
                reasonably required to verify identity and investigate the matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Swiftline will acknowledge, assess and respond within the period required by applicable law. Complex
                matters, identity checks, active legal claims, customs investigations or regulatory restrictions may
                require additional time.

              <SubHeading>24.2 Complaints to authorities</SubHeading>
              <p>
                Individuals may also have the right to complain to the competent data-protection authority. For
                processing in the United Kingdom, this may include the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office. For
                processing in India, this may include the authority or Data Protection Board having jurisdiction under
                applicable law.
              </p>
              <p>
                We encourage individuals to contact the Grievance Officer first so that Swiftline has an opportunity to
                investigate and resolve the concern promptly.
